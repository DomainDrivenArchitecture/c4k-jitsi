Issue: 
eventually low performance cpu settings (clientside, VM?) keeps troubling in audio performance (delays, also interruption) //Todo: jitsi in VM?
```

- something read about: put `config.js` in `/usr/share/jitsi-meet` - in pod at `/config/config.js`

    Should be discussed:
    ```In a Jitsi conference, the client and JVB work in tandem to ensure efficient video streaming. This involves an ongoing exchange of sender and receiver video constraints.

    Receiver Constraints: 
    Each participant sends constraints (e.g., desired resolution and priority) to the JVB for the video streams they want to receive. These constraints are influenced by the participantâ€™s current layout (e.g., larger tiles for active speakers).

    Sender Constraints: 
    JVB aggregates these constraints and communicates the required video resolutions to the senders. This ensures a participant only sends higher-resolution streams (e.g., 720p) if at least one other participant views them in a sufficiently large tile.
    ```
  "evtentually" there are competing requests from different client-server tasks that differ in `resolution` <-> `videoQuality`  
  -> //Todo: Check logs, grafana?

- What about ff. custom settings, done by gec  
  https://repo.prod.meissa.de/meissa/c4k-jitsi/commit/f4fe85907db422206833ee95796f2b4bcec375a9

  ```js
  // CUSTOM ADJUSTMENTS
    config.disableThirdPartyRequests = true;
    config.channelLastN = 8;
    config.enableLayerSuspension = true; // https://jitsi-club.gitlab.io/jitsi-self-hosting/en/01-deployment-howto/03-tuning/#recommended_enable_layer_suspension
  ```

  eventually no memory leak, but how is cpu & memory performance of JVB pod, are there any abnormalities if audio issue occurs? 

## Testserver needed - to be discussed
  1. Are there any changes made to config, after adding ff. to `src/main/resources/jitsi/web-config-envs-cm.yaml`  

    ```yml
    VIDEOQUALITY: "480"  
    VIDEOQUALITY_AV1: "480"  ## AV1 is primary default codec, throttling/performance described in [AV1_jitsi]  
    AUDIO_QUALITY_OPUS_BITRATE: "null" ##set default variable bitrate - beware, noice cancelling, auto level noise, etc., would be turned off  
    ```   
          https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-configuration/#videoquality
          https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-configuration/#audioquality  
          //Todo{low prio}: Maybe we should kick out h.264 ??

  2. `config.js` in `/usr/share/jitsi-meet` -> Todo: Result?

  3. Should default setting 720p `resolution` & `videoQuality` do the job ?? described as default value, eventually that's well tested on jitsi development side.

  controversial to [AV1 jitsi]  
  
  4. Testing Parameters `config.js`  
  https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/config.js#L88  
    Example:  
    // P2P test mode disables automatic switching to P2P when there are 2  
      // participants in the conference.  
      // p2pTestMode: false,  
  
## Test-server circumstances:  

All circumstances measured by 3rd person on "neutral" extern client within grafana  
In general, every circumstance should be done like ff: 
* 2 participants under normal workload {like weekly presentation}
* 2 participants under normal workload {like weekly presentation} using and "Testserver needed"/4. T.Parameters configured true, see above ```p2pTestMode: true,```   
* 3 participants under normal workload {like weekly presentation}
* automated N participants under normal workload {like weekly presentation}

1. Run at default values `720p`, no entries to any video settings in `web-config-envs-cm.yaml`, branch video_performance_issue commit a94563ff96 from zam 28.02.2025

2. RUN with `480p` in&out   
  - branch `test_480p` commit `0ce1f19935` from zam 28.02.2025

3. Run with `VP9`, as first element of preferedOrder
  - branch should be done

4. well running codec but no `h.264`
  - branch should be done
